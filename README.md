# Learn about Merkle Trees and Bitcoin

It's easy to miss at first glance, the brilliance of some of the inventions
behind Bitcoin. Like computers in an internet swarm being able to communicate
and collaborate with each other quite routinely despite some of them lying
deliberately with criminal or malicious intent. At the heart of this brilliance
lie Merkle Trees; the subject of this article. It's a teaching article, with
accompanying code (in Go).

Read the **article.txt** first.
And then the code, starting with **main.go** in the _src_ subdirectory.

Don't worry if you are not familiar with Go code; it's easy to read.
