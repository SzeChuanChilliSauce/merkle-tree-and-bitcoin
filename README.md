# Merkle Trees and Bitcoin

This repository is a learning resource for two topics
  - Merkle Trees (the computer science)
  - Their particular use in Bitcoin

It contains:
  - A background / primer article
  - Some Go (Golang) code that demonstrates the Bitcoin use-case

It is intended that your read the **article.txt** first. And then start looking at the code in **main.go** in the _src_ subdirectory. The **main.go** module begins with a big comment section that provides a bridge between the article and the code.
