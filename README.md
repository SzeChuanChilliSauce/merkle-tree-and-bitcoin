# Merkle Trees and Bitcoin

This repository is a learning resource for two topics
  - Merkle Trees (the computer science)
  - Their particular use in Bitcoin

It contains:
  - A background / primer article
  - Some simple Go (Golang) code that demonstrates the Bitcoin use-case

It is intended that your read the **article.txt** first. And then start looking
at the code in **main.go** in the _src_ subdirectory. The **main.go** module
begins with a big comment section that provides a bridge between the article
and the code.

The code is very simple by design, to make it a suitable learning resource. While
it provides an honest illustration of the same Merkle Tree validation that
Bitcoin uses, it does so in the form of a cut-down example that strips out all
the complexity from a real Bitcoin implementation that is not needed for the
illustration.
